A message forwarder. Every time the `trigger` input is fired, the `on_trigger` output is fired.

Note: this entity works by creating a function containing all the output commands, which is fired every time the trigger is called.
This means that the compile-time instigator entity of the IO chain is reset to this entity. If this behaviour is undesired, `logic_filter`
should be used instead.

@attribute delay Delay The amount of ticks to wait after recieving an input to fire the outputs. Note: this resets the executor if set to other than zero.
@attribute executorOverride "Executor Override" Target selector to execute the command. If blank, executed as executor. Cannot be used in junction with Delay.
