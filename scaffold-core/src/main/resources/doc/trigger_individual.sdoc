Fires an output when entities enter and exit the trigger volume.

Unline `trigger_multiple`, this trigger is able to target individual entities. When an entity triggers an output, the output is fired *as* that entity.
This is significantly more expensive than `trigger_multiple`, so it should only be used when we need to target the executor later in the IO chain.

@attribute scope Scope The scope of entities to listen for.
@attribute start_disabled "Start Disabled" Start with this trigger disabled.
@attribute use_event_functions "Use Event Functions" If unchecked, only the 'on_entity_tick' output is fired to save on performance.
