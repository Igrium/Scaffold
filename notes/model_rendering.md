Just trying to collect my thoughts about the model parsing system.

**Model parsing system**

* Element tag -> Shape
* Master registry of shapes is held; registry stores block model the shape comes from for lookup.
* Registry has a "get shape" function that gets the shape from a blockmodel. If loaded, returns existing shape. If not, registers shape.
* getShape can also be called with an already-loaded json object, assuming you know the filepath it came from.

**Shape Notes**
* *What does Indices on the chunk mesh mean?*
* `Shape.createVertex()` creates an origin point at the bottom-center of the block.
* `multipleImages` only affects the UVs.
* There is no standalone geometry generated by the shape; it is added directly to the chunk mesh (I might have to add an abstraction layer to support standalone loading).
